# KAGGLE HOUSE PRICING COMPETITION
Hello, welcome to my github :)

In this notebook I will describe my process to predict houses prices based on explanatory variables such as the area, the number of rooms, the year when the house was built, etc.

This project comes from a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course

I want to show that it is possible to get a good score by applying simple data sciences principles, without using overly complicated models or spending days tweaking hyperparameters. I think that the most critical principle is: spend a good amount of time understanding and preparing the data, and you should do well.

I tried to make the code as readable and simple as possible, if something is not clear please send me a message.

In the same fashion, if you spot some mistakes, bad practices or bits that could be improved, by all means tell me so I can learn as well :)

Side note: although you can reach a nice position in the leaderboard by copying and pasting this code (currently TOP 4% out of 60.000 teams), this notebook is intended to learn about data science, not to perform well in a competition.
This is why I am not using some "unethical" techniques such as using data leakage voluntarily which could allow my code to perform better in this competition - but worse in a hypotethical real life scenario :)

I wish you a nice time learning
